# Conventional Commits 1.0.0

## Summary

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention for commit messages. It provides a simple set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, making it easier to build automated tools. This convention works well with SemVer by describing features, fixes, and breaking changes in commit messages.

## Commit Message Structure



### Types

- `fix`: patches a bug in your codebase (correlates with PATCH in SemVer)
- `feat`: introduces a new feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer)
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: indicates a breaking API change (correlates with MAJOR in SemVer)
- Other types are allowed: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, etc.

### Scope

A scope may be provided to a commit’s type for additional context, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

## Examples

- Commit with description and breaking change footer:


- Commit with `!` for breaking change:
- Commit with scope and `!`:
- Commit with both `!` and BREAKING CHANGE footer:
- Commit with no body:
- Commit with scope:
- Commit with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers:
## Specification Highlights

- Commits **MUST** be prefixed with a type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`), optional scope, optional `!`, and a colon.
- The description **MUST** follow the colon and space.
- A longer commit body **MAY** be provided after the description, starting one blank line after.
- One or more footers **MAY** be provided one blank line after the body.
- Breaking changes **MUST** be indicated in the type/scope prefix or as a footer.
- Types other than `feat` and `fix` **MAY** be used.
- `BREAKING CHANGE` **MUST** be uppercase.

## Why Use Conventional Commits?

- Automatically generate CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determine semantic version bumps.
- Communicate the nature of changes to teammates and stakeholders.
- Trigger build and publish processes.
- Make it easier for contributors to understand commit history.

## FAQ

- **Initial development phase:** Proceed as if you’ve already released the product.
- **Type casing:** Any casing may be used, but be consistent.
- **Multiple types:** Make multiple commits whenever possible.
- **Rapid development:** Encourages organized commits for long-term speed.
- **Custom types:** Teams can define their own types.
- **SemVer relation:** `fix` → PATCH, `feat` → MINOR, `BREAKING CHANGE` → MAJOR.
- **Wrong type:** Use `git rebase -i` to edit history before merging.
- **Non-spec type:** The commit will be missed by spec-based tools.
- **Contributor requirement:** Not mandatory for all contributors.
- **Revert commits:** Use `revert` type and reference SHAs in the footer.
